# LearnToChef.com — Elite Mega-Site Blueprint (README)
## The World’s Greatest Chef Archive + The Global Technique Encyclopedia (Video-Anchored)

---

# Executive Vision

**LearnToChef.com** is not a recipe site.

It is a category-defining culinary mega-site that merges:

- chef biography as curriculum  
- cuisine mastery as progression  
- technique as encyclopedia  
- and video as the source of truth  

The spine of the platform is:

> **Every major chef in history — and the step-by-step path to cook like them.**

Not in a vague inspirational way.

In a structured, stage-by-stage way:

- apprentice phase  
- early restaurant phase  
- signature style phase  
- peak mastery phase  
- legacy phase  

And for every skill, dish, or technique:

> It must be anchored to a real video from YouTube.

This makes LearnToChef.com:

- proof-based  
- deeply learnable  
- endlessly explorable  
- addictive for food lovers  
- and unbelievably scalable for SEO/AEO

# 1) The Core Market Gap

The internet has:

- recipes (millions)
- YouTube cooking (infinite)
- chef biographies (Wikipedia)
- culinary school curriculums (paywalled)

But it does NOT have:

## A single master site that teaches cooking through the lives and techniques of the world’s greatest chefs — with a structured learning path and video anchors.

That is LearnToChef.com.

---

# 2) Category Definition

## LearnToChef.com
### Chef-Based Learning + Technique Mastery + Video Anchoring

This site is a hybrid of:

- MasterClass (but free and comprehensive)
- Wikipedia (but curriculum-based)
- a culinary school (but self-paced)
- YouTube (but structured and indexed)

---

# 3) The Two-Layer Architecture (The Moat)

LearnToChef.com has two massive layers:

---

## Layer A — The Chef Spine (Cultural + Narrative)
Every major chef becomes a learning path.

Users don’t just read about chefs.
They learn cooking through them.

---

## Layer B — The Technique Encyclopedia (Skill + Mastery)
Every major technique becomes a staged learning ladder.

Users don’t just watch random videos.
They master cooking systematically.

---

# 4) The Chef Spine (Crown Jewel)

## The Chef Index
A global directory of chefs, sortable by:

- country
- cuisine
- era
- style (classic / modernist / rustic / pastry / street food)
- difficulty
- philosophy (simplicity vs precision vs experimentation)

Each chef profile is a curriculum.

---

## The Chef Curriculum Page (Template)

Each chef page includes:

### 1) The Story (fast, high-signal)

### 6) The Video Anchors (Non-Negotiable)
